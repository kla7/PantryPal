# PantryPal

**Authors:** Joyce Guo, Kasey La, Sohini Roy

PantryPal is an application that functions as a recipe recommendation system. It is meant to be useful for users that
have many ingredients but donâ€™t know what to make with them. PantryPal suggests what recipe to make, along with the
full ingredient list and directions of the recipe, depending on the user input of ingredients.

## Instructions

The instructions for running the app are as follows:

### Docker

Build the Docker image.
```
docker build -t pantrypal .
```

Run an interactive container.
* For Bash:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 -v $(pwd):/app pantrypal /bin/bash
```
* For Windows Powershell:
```
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/app -p 8501:8501 pantrypal /bin/bash
```

### Streamlit

To run the app:
* In the container, run
```
streamlit run app.py
```

* The default server is http://localhost:8501/

## App Features

* A select box where users can choose as many ingredients as they would like to include in their search.
* **Selection types:** Inclusive or exclusive search.
  * **Inclusive:** Recipes shown will include ingredients outside of the selected ingredients. 
  * **Exclusive:** Recipes shown will only contain ingredients from the selected ingredients.
* Filter options:
  * **Search keywords:** Keywords that the user can input, such as "pasta" or "Chinese", for more refined search
  results.
  * **Dietary restrictions:** Offers multiple choices for common types of diet restrictions, such as "vegetarian".
  * **Avoid list:** Ingredients that the user would like to exclude from the search, whether for allergies or
  preferences.
* Multiple search results are shown, with each recipe's title, list of ingredients, and list of directions.
* Optional login which unlocks the ability to save recipes for future reference.
* A list of all saved recipes can be seen in the sidebar.
  * A single saved recipe can be selected to be expanded, where its title, list of ingredients, and list of directions
  can be seen.
  * Each saved recipe can be removed if no longer needed.

## Contents of this repository

This folder contains 14 files and 1 directory:

4. **app.py**, a script containing the Streamlit app.
5. **cleanup.py**, a script that removes inedible recipes from the dataset.
6. **extract_dataset.py**, a script that extracts various metadata from the dataset for data mining purposes.
7. **extract_ingredients.py**, a script that extracts ingredients from the measurements for each recipe.
8. **faiss_index.py**, a script that creates the FAISS index file as well as the metadata file used for vector search.
9. **preprocess.py**, a script that extracts the recipe title, measurements, and directions for a subset of the dataset.
10. **search.py**, a script that handles querying with FAISS.
11. **cleaned_ingredients.json**, a file containing the extracted ingredients outputted from **extract_ingredients.py**.

## Steps for replication

Please note that these steps are for generating the `recipe_index.faiss` and `recipe_metadata.json` files which are
already provided within the `search` subdirectory for convenience, since the script takes a bit to run. To run the app,
please follow the steps in the [Instructions section](https://github.com/kla7/PantryPal#instructions) above.

* Download the raw dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/recipenlg).
* Follow the steps in the [Instructions section](https://github.com/kla7/PantryPal#instructions) to open up an
interactive container.
* In the container, run `preprocess.py` to retrieve a small subset of the dataset in `recipes_50k.jsonl`. E.g.,
```
python preprocess.py RecipeNLG_50k.csv processed
```
* In the container, run `cleanup.py` to retrieve a cleaned recipes.jsonl file (e.g., `clean_recipes_50k.jsonl`). E.g.,
```
python cleanup.py processed/recipes_50k.jsonl cleaned_recipes_50k.jsonl
```
* In the container, run `faiss_index.py` using the cleaned recipes .jsonl file (e.g., `clean_recipes_50k.jsonl`) to retrieve
`recipe_index.faiss` and `recipe_metadata.json`. E.g.,
```
python faiss_index.py cleaned_recipes_50k.jsonl search
```
  * In `app.py`, these two files are being retrieved from a directory called `search`. Please either add
`recipe_index.faiss` and `recipe_metadata.json` to a subdirectory named `search` or adjust the code in `app.py`
to reflect the correct location of the files.
